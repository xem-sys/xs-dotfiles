### xs.dotfiles

**A personal Linux dotfiles collection**

These are absolutely not organized for any particular system. I personally use Manjaro for my home and Debian on servers, both of which utilize a ~/.config/$app structure so most of these directories would live there.

The ServerConfigs directory contains example configs for web or local servers.

You should absolutely adapt these files for your config/system before attempting to use them.

Pretty much everything here is an adaptation of other's work. I claim zero ownership.
